# Student Academic Plans

## Uses Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm (K-Modes Clustering) to gain insights from the dataset to help students finish their college
### Data Source: DAC UNPAD
### Steps:
#### 1. Load Libaries & Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Data Analysis Competition by Universitas Padjajaran in Indonesia, containing students informations (name, gender, status, address, GPA, and etc.)
#### 2. Data Understanding
- Checking dataset's variables and its data types
- Checking missing values
#### 3. Data Cleaning
- Remove missing values
- Remove duplicated data
- Remove unimportant variables
#### 4. Data Pre-processing
Convert categorical data into numerical data using Label Encoding.
#### 5. Clustering
- Determine the number of clusters using Elbow Method and Calinski Harabasz Method
- Clustering the data using K-Modes Algorithm
#### 6. Visualizing the Results
Using barplots, visualize the clustering results based on each variables to find out the characteristics of each cluster.
